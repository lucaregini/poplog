$usepop/CHANGES-PRELINKED.txt

This is an experimental new version of Poplog, based on Poplog v15.65, available
at
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/latest-poplog

but designed not to be re-linked when installed because at present re-linking
32bit poplog does not work in 64-bit Linux whereas use of a pre-linked 32-bit
poplog does work.

The details of this version will later be described more fully here.

Basically it should function exactly like Poplog v15.65, and the Poplog
variable popversion has not been changed yet.

The only easily detectable difference will be that
    /usr/local/poplog/current-poplog

is linked to
    /usr/local/poplog/prelinked-v15.65

I may later arrange for a global Pop11 variable pop_prelinked to be set.

WATCH THIS SPACE!
